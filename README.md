AI-Powered PDF Q&A Chatbot
This project is an intelligent chatbot that answers questions based on the content of uploaded PDF files.

🎯 Goal:
To implement a chatbot using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) that analyzes PDF documents and generates context-aware responses.

🛠️ Key Steps:
Set Up LangChain & OpenAI API

Install dependencies: langchain, openai, pdf-parse or pdfjs, chromadb.

Configure OpenAI API keys.

PDF Processing

Enable PDF upload.

Extract text using pdf-parse or similar tool.

Chunking & Embedding

Use TextSplitter from LangChain to divide text into logical parts.

Generate embeddings with text-embedding-ada-002.

Store embeddings in a vector DB like ChromaDB or Pinecone.

Implement RAG

Retrieve relevant document chunks when the user asks a question.

Feed both question and retrieved text into the GPT model.

Return answers grounded in the PDF content.

Chat Interface

Build a Node.js API (or use React/Next.js).

Create a user-friendly chat interface.
